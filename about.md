<!-- [Stripstarter](http://stripstarter.us) is a social crowdsourcing application.

Want to see Barack Obama naked?  Make a campaign -- or pledge money to an existing one -- and make it happen!

### Pledgers

You can make a campaign for anyone, for any set of deliverables.  If they deliver they receive the money, and you receive the media.  Campaign for pictures, video, audio, or any media-based performance.

Alternatively, find campaigns you want to see funded, and pledge money towards them.  You're only charged after the campaign is funded and the good are delivered!

### Performers

Are you on the site?  Great!*  If the terms of your campaign and funding level are to your liking, talk to us about fulfilling the campaign by delivering on its terms and claim your reward.

###### *Please don't sue us.

Alternatively, make a campaign for yourself -- anyone can do this!  Set a list of deliverables people can pledge towards, deliver, and claim your pile of cash.

### Is this even legal?

We're not sure yet, but you'll be the second to know! -->

[Stripstarter](http://stripstarter.us) is a crowdfunding platform for media production.

You can sign up as a pledger or performer and make campaigns for video, photo, or audio that don't exist yet, anywhere from a celebrity to your local barista.

**Let's give a real-world example:**

Suppose you want to see pictures of that cute waitress, Jane Doe, in a bikini.  Create a campaign and give it a pledge, or contribute to an existing one.  Over time, other users may contribute to your campaign.  The beauty of this is that it's for *anyone* - from pictures of Jane to specifically requested video of a movie star.  When the campaign succeeds, the pledgers get the media.

**What's the likelihood of these campaigns actually working?**

Well, since you don't get charged unless it actually comes to fruition, the only thing that browsing our site costs is your time.  It's a pretty novel idea, too -- one which might get media coverage.

If it does, people will invariably check the site to see if they're on it.  Jane hears about Stripstarter and finds out that she can make $500 for a series of photographs.  Given enough campaigns, the odds are that a non-trivial amount will actually happen.

**Make a campaign for yourself!**

The highest likelihood of money changing hands comes from desirable people who know their comfort level, and making their own campaign.  Once it reaches a level you're happy with, simply submit the promised media and receive the funding.

There can be multiple campaigns centered around the same person, each with different promises.  Contribute to one, many, or create a new one that suits your needs.

**Can I use it anonymously?**

Users who register as pledgers are anonymous.  We keep track of who you are internally, but there is no public information associated with your account.  Campaigns will list numbers of pledgers and contributions, but that's it.

Performer accounts have some public information, and are created when a campaign is made.  In our example above, Jane Doe would be given an account when her campaign was created.  Obviously, we don't want to represent you against your will and will respond immediately to takedown requests.

**Is this legal?**

We have absolutely no idea.  You'll be the <s>first</s> second to know.

**Is this ethical?**

Pornography as a concept aside, the current practice and industry often violates free agency and dignity of those involved, and porn consumption can have its own domestic considerations that are not our place to address here.

However, by creating an inclusive crowdfunding platform we believe that the balance of power shifts closer to equality between the performer and consumer, and away from the practices of industry.

In our current model, we create personas for people who have not given their express consent.  While common practice among tech companies, we are trying to come up with an alternative solution that does not violate dignity of those who do not wish to participate.
